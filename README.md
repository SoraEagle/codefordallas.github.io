# Code for Dallas Website

This is currently a work in progress (WIP).

Our volunteers are currently working on different sections independently. We are building the structure with HTML and CSS to ensure proper placement before finalizing text, specific images, colors, animations, etc.

Once the basic structure has been outlined, we will bring everything together into a single React app.

Color & animations to be done last, since we will need to optimize after integration.

Participation is open to all Code For Dallas volunteers looking to grow their skills in open source collaboration, project management, HTML, CSS, React, etc.

## Explanation of Branches

Since we are using this as a group project as well as a learning tool, we are going about things a bit differently than most people consider "best practices". This is because we want those who may come later to see the steps taken and progression made with this project.

We decided we wanted to leave the original code in case there was something we wanted to reuse. You can find that information in the following **locked** branches:
1. [wireframe](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/tree/wireframe) - pre 2023 wireframe
2. [pre2023](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/tree/pre2023) - pre 2023 code for a website that we have not been using but may contain code we would want to reuse

Our first step was to build the "bare bones" for our React app. This meant we needed the HTML and CSS for the different planned components, as outlined by the wireframe. These updates were done under the [wireframe2023](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/tree/wireframe2023) branch via these PRs:
- [#36](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/pull/36) for header
- [#34](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/pull/34) for about section
- [#37](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/pull/37) for projects
- [#48](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/pull/48) for donations section
- [#35](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/pull/35) for footer

The integration into a React app was meant to be a learning session with all volunteers. It was found during prep that this would not be possible, as there were several issues that needed to be addressed before integration. This was completed under [issue39-reactapp](https://github.com/codefordallas/codefordallas.github.io/tree/issue39-reactapp) branch and will be used during the next group meeting for walkthrough of what was done, which will also be used to discuss:
- next steps (including announcement of moving to real best practices, since the React app brings everything together)
- better ways to have done the React app creation from "vanilla HTML/CSS/JS"
- feedback from our React gurus on additional suggestions for improved site
